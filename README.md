## Introduction
Header-only C library for reading/writing 64-bit Arm registers, automatically
generated by parsing the AArch64 System Register XML.

All functions are declared `static inline` and all file-scope variables are
declared `static const`, so modern optimizing compilers like `gcc` and `clang`
at `-O1` and above will collapse each call down down to an average of 1-4
instructions with no branches and the variables are stripped out completely,
using no storage.

The library includes compilation tests for all parsed system registers, which have
been all been successfully built using both `gcc` and `clang` and with the
`-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror` flags.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Beautiful Soup 4 for XML parsing (`pip3.8 install beautifulsoup4`)
- C compiler supporting at least C99 with C11 extensions

### Known working compilers
* aarch64-none-elf-gcc (GCC) 7.2.0:
  - C99: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99 -O2`
  - C11: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c11 -O2`

* Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62): *
  - C99: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99 -O2 --target=aarch64-none-elf`
  - C11: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c11 -O2 --target=aarch64-none-elf`

\* Apple Clang also tested with `--target=aarch64-linux-gnu`.


## High-level functionality

### Bitfields
Availability: All system registers.

All parsed system registers define a `union` of the form:

    union sctlr_el1
    {
        u64 _;
        struct
        {
            u64 m : 1;
            u64 a : 1;
            u64 c : 1;
            u64 sa : 1;
            ...
        };
    };

The `._` member allows for raw access to the underlying register value while the
anonymous `struct` member allows for manipulation of the register's constituent
bit fields.


### Safe values
Availability: All writeable system registers.

The safe value for a writeable system register has all currently or previously
`RES1` fields set to `1` and all currently or previously `RES0` fields cleared
to `0`. These values are used by the `safe_write_<reg>()` convenience macros,
or you can use them yourself when manually constructing a value to write into
a register using `unsafe_write_<reg>()`.

Examples:

    static const union sctlr_el1 SCTLR_EL1_SAFEVAL =
    {
        .itd = 1,
        .sed = 1,
        .eos = 1,
        .tscxt = 1,
        .eis = 1,
        .span = 1,
        .ntlsmd = 1,
        .lsmaoe = 1,
    };

    static const union tcr_el3 TCR_EL3_SAFEVAL =
    {
        .res1_23 = 1,
        .res1_31 = 1,
    };


### Reads
Availability: All readable system registers.

Read the current value of a system register into a field-accessible structure:

    /* C code */
    #include "sysreg/mpidr_el1.h"
    u64 foo( void )
    {
        return read_mpidr_el1().aff0;
    }

    /* Compiler output */
    mrs     x8, mpidr_el1
    and     x0, x8, #0xff
    ret


### Writes

#### Unsafe write
Availability: All writeable system registers.

Write a field-accessible structure into a system register. This function is
prefixed `unsafe_` to emphasise the fact that it has no provision for helping to ensure that any currently or previously `RES1` fields are set to `1`; when using
this function it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that any such
bits are set appropriately so as to ensure both correct behaviour and future portability. For this reason, it is recommended that you instead use
`safe_write_<reg>()` wherever possible, or use `<REG>_SAFEVAL` as a basis for
the value being constructed.

    /* C code */
    #include "sysreg/sctlr_el1.h"
    void foo( void )
    {
        union sctlr_el1 val = { .m=1, .c=1, .i=1 };
        unsafe_write_sctlr_el1(val);
    }

    /* Compiler output */
    mov     w8, #0x1005         // Danger! No RES1 bits set! See safe_write_<reg>()
    msr     sctlr_el1, x8
    ret

Use the `union`'s `._` member to write a raw value:

    /* C code */
    #include "sysreg/sctlr_el1.h"
    void foo( u64 raw )
    {
        union sctlr_el1 val = { ._=raw };
        unsafe_write_sctlr_el1(val);
    }

    /* Compiler output */
    msr     sctlr_el1, x0
    ret


#### Safe write
Availability: All writeable system registers.

Use `safe_write_<reg>()` to set a variadic list of fields. Any fields not
specified in the variadic list that are currently or previously `RES1` will be
set to `1`, and all other fields will be cleared to `0`.

For example:

    /* C code */
    #include "sysreg/sctlr_el1.h"
    void foo( void )
    {
        safe_write_sctlr_el1( .m=1, .c=1, .i=1 );
    }

    /* compiler output */
    mov     w8, #0x1985
    movk    w8, #0x30d0, lsl #16
    msr     sctlr_el1, x8
    ret

Note how while we only specified `.m=1`, `.c=1`, and `.i=1`, the value written
to `SCTLR_EL1` also has all currently or previously `RES1` fields set to `1`,
such as `.itd=1`, `.sed=1`, `.eos=1`, etc.

Repeating the same, but this time explicitly clearing one of those currently or previously `RES1` fields to `0` in the variadic list:

    /* in C */
    #include "sysreg/sctlr_el1.h"
    void foo( void )
    {
        safe_write_sctlr_el1( .m=1, .c=1, .i=1, .itd=0 );
    }

    /* compiler output */
    mov     w8, #0x1905
    movk    w8, #0x30d0, lsl #16
    msr     sctlr_el1, x8
    ret

Here we can see bit \[7\] corresponding to `.itd` in the first `MOV` has been
cleared; the value moved into `w8` is now `0x1905` vs `0x1985` in the earlier
example.


### Read-modify-write
Availability: All system registers that are both readable and writeable.

Use `read_modify_write_<reg>()` to read the current value of a system register,
set a variadic list of fields in that value, then write the result back.

    /* in C */
    void foo( void )
    {
        read_modify_write_sctlr_el1( .m=1, .c=1, .i=1 );
    }

    /* compiler output */
    mrs     x8, sctlr_el1
    mov     w9, #0x1005
    orr     x8, x8, x9
    msr     sctlr_el1, x8
    ret

NOTE: Many AArch64 system registers have architecturally UNKNOWN values at
reset, meaning you should *not* perform a read-modify-write sequence when first
initializing them. Instead, use `safe_write_<reg>()` to guarantee that all
currently or previously `RES1` fields are set to `1` and all other unspecified
fields are cleared to `0`.


## Building the library

### Step 1) Obtain AArch64 System Register XML

Download and extract the AArch64 System Register XML from the
[Arm A-Profile CPU architecture exploration tools page](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/exploration-tools).

Alternatively, use `curl` to download the Armv8.6-A XML published in June 2020:

    curl -O https://developer.arm.com/-/media/developer/products/architecture/armv8-a-architecture/2020-06/SysReg_xml_v86A-2020-06.tar.gz
    tar xf SysReg_xml_v86A-2020-06.tar.gz

### Step 2) Build

Run the provided `run-build.py` script, pointing it at the AArch64 System Register
XML downloaded and extracted earlier:

    python3.8 run-build.py /path/to/SysReg_xml_v86A-2020-06

### Step 3) Test

Run the provided `run-tests.py` script, pointing it at your chosen compiler:

    python3.8 run-tests.py [--keep] /path/to/aarch64-none-elf-gcc

It is assumed the compiler uses the same switches as `gcc` and `clang`, and the
script always invokes the compiler with the following flags:

    -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror

You may pass additional flags to the `run-tests.py` script which will be passed
in turn to the compiler, for example:

    python3.8 run-tests.py /path/to/aarch64-none-elf-gcc -std=c99 -O3  

If no `-std` flag is provided, the script defaults to `-std=c11`.

If no `-O` flag is provided, the script defaults to `-O2`.

If the compiler path contains substring `clang` and no `--target` flag is provided,
the script defaults to `--target=aarch64-none-elf`.

By default the script will cleanup the generated .o object files after finishing
the test run. Pass the `--keep` flag before the path to the compiler if you wish
to keep these files.
